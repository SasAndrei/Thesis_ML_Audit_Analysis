Define project Define a project you have access to by passing in the project id.

The project id can be found in the URL in the following format\+: {\ttfamily \href{https://public.md.ai/annotator/project/{project_id}}{\texttt{ https\+://public.\+md.\+ai/annotator/project/\{project\+\_\+id\}}}}. For example, {\ttfamily project\+\_\+id} would be {\ttfamily XXXX} for {\ttfamily \href{https://public.md.ai/annotator/project/XXXX}{\texttt{ https\+://public.\+md.\+ai/annotator/project/\+XXXX}}}. Specify optional {\ttfamily path} as the data directory (if left blank, will default to current working directory).
